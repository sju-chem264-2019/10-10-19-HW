# "Lab" Report

Look at the attached organic dehydration mechanism. Tomorrow I will post a detailed aassignment, but for tonight, discuss with your group how you might use electronic structure to determine the best mechanism and determine the effect of electron withdrawing groups or elctron donating groups.

Try top estimate what you think the conclusions and results will look like, what methods you need to use, any difficulties you might encounter, and what you might do to solve them. Start building the structures in Gaussian.
